# Morse
A morse transmitter and receiver all written in Scratch (mBlock).
This project is perfect if done by pairs of students, one for receiver and one for transmitter.
## Step 1: What You Will Need
To build this project we need two Arduino UNO and, optionally, a 100 Î© resistor, an active piezoelectric buzzer (a buzzer that beeps only powering it) and a breadboard.
